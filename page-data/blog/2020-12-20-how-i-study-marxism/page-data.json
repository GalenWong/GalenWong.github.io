There are things that I cannot understand under the current system\non how majority of the world runs (aka capitalism). I set out to explore how\nMarxism view capitalism and what the lessons are to be learned. Fun fact,\nundergraduates in most Chinese university are <a href=\"https://news.cgtn.com/news/3d3d414d30676a4d77457a6333566d54/share_p.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">required to study\nMarxism</a>!</p>\n<p>This blog serves as my journal on how I studied Marxism. I will also be\nsharing my notes and providing links to the resources I used.</p>\n<p>Now, where do we start? I found this article from the NYU professor Bertell\nOllman titled ”<a href=\"https://www.nyu.edu/projects/ollman/docs/ssr_ch05.php#4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">On Teaching\nMarixsm</a>”. I used it\nas the backbone of my own humble syllabus. It also makes some great points\nabout the challenges faced when teaching Marxism in an American universities.\nThe three factors are (1) the default materialistic ideology of the students,\n(2) the social and ideological constraints that are part of university\nsetting (the fact that we live in a capitalist society), and (3) the absence\nof a vital socialist movement. Understand these constraints hopefully help me\nto resolve any bias before going into the study, such that I can appreciate\nMarxism better.</p>\n<p>Professor Bertell also emphasized three main aspects of Marxism in the\narticle: (1) the dialectics, (2) the theory of class struggle, and (3) Marx’s\ncritique of bourgeois ideology. I will attempt to follow the framework as a\nguide to my study.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dialectics\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#dialectics\" aria-label=\"dialectics permalink\" class=\"gatsby-remark-autolink-headers-a-tags before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Dialectics</h2>\n<p>First, we start off with dialectics. According to the <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hegel-dialectics/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Stanford Encyclopedia\nof Philosophy</a>,\ndialectics is describes “a method of philosophical argument that involves\nsome sort of contradictory process between opposing sides”. How I understand\nit, with a bad deep learning analogy, is that dialectics resembles the\nprocess of a generative adversary network (GAN). Two opposing values try to\nargue against each other, but both party learn from the other party as well.\nI don’t recommend reading into the Encyclopedia too much. As a newbie in\nphilosophy, the terms are hard to understand.</p>\n<p>More specifically, the study of Marxism employs the Hegelian dialectic. Here\nis <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q54VyCpXDH8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">a video of Hegelian dialectic by The School of\nLife</a>. It looks at it from a\nhistorical perspective but gives a good sense of what dialectic feels like.</p>\n<p>Another good introduction to Hegelian dialectics is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgNt1C72B_4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">one by Philosophy\nTube</a>. It covers the Hegelian\ndialectics and how identity politics can be explained through the lens of\nHegel, but also some criticism about Hegel’s method.</p>\n<p>Now, this is just an introduction to Hegelian dialectic. To tie it back to\nMarx, professor Ollman wrote an entire book, called the “Dance of the\nDialectic”, on dialectics analysis in Marxism. Dialectics in Marxism itself\nis a complex subject in which a quarter/semester of time can be spent on\nstudying it. To get a quick grasp, read the <a href=\"https://www.nyu.edu/projects/ollman/docs/dd_ch01.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">introduction\nchapter</a> of the book.</p>\n<p>The chapter points out something that runs contradicts from the previous\nvideos on introduction to Hegelian dialectics, and I quote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Dialectics is not a rock-ribbed triad of thesis-antithesis- synthesis that\nserves as an all-purpose explanation; nor does it provide a formula that\nenables us to prove or predict anything; nor is it the motor force of\nhistory.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, I don’t think this is a contradiction between different sources. In\nthis chapter, professor Ollman is stressing that dialectics is the method\nthat Marx used to study any subject. </p>\n<p>Professor Ollman explains how Marx disregards perception as evidence of\ntruth, meaning whatever we see, hear, smell, feel cannot be based off to form\nour understanding. Even those these measures are taken scientifically or\nprocessed error-free in a computer. The argument is that on a viewer draws\nconclusion from what the viewer perceive an entity is greatly affected by the\nenvironment. More importantly, the viewer themselves can be affected by their\nown context. Example, a capitalist might see a machine as a thing that makes\nhim money, but a worker might see a machine as a thing that guides the\nworker’s movement during production.</p>\n<p>This brings to how fundamentally Marx understands the world. Instead of\nstand-alone event, institution, person, or process, they are all connected\nand affects each other. This means Marx looks at the world as a connected\nwhole.</p>\n<h2 id=\"factvalue-distinction\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#factvalue-distinction\" aria-label=\"factvalue distinction permalink\" class=\"gatsby-remark-autolink-headers-a-tags before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Fact/Value Distinction</h2>\n<p>What follows very naturally from Marx’s distrust in perception is his dispute\nof the fact and value distinction. We think of “fact” as something always\ntrue in universally and always holds under any condition. According the Marx\nthen, so such thing called “fact” can exist since nothing can be interpreted\nto be the identical under any context. Everything we think of as fact is\nstill influenced by our value, or what we think to be true, and how we\nperceive it. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12115-013-9709-2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">This article</a>\ngives a good explanation on the fact/value distinction. It is long and\nclobbered with philosophy terms and requires some solid background.\nTherefore, I would recommend reading the introductory section to grasp the\noverall idea. Then move on to the first (“Two Versions of the Fact/Value\nDistinction”) and second (“Critiques of the Fact/Value Distinction”) section\nto understand what the distinction is and how it is disputed. After, that\njumps to the “Ethical Naturalism and Sociology” section and read how Marx\nargued against the fact/value distinction.</p>\n<h3 id=\"notes-poli-sci-118-lec-10\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#notes-poli-sci-118-lec-10\" aria-label=\"notes poli sci 118 lec 10 permalink\" class=\"gatsby-remark-autolink-headers-a-tags before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Notes: poli sci 118 lec 10</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>the structure of micro-story/macro-story and the invisible hand theory </li>\n<li>assumption: the ultimate good with most value is personal freedom</li>\n<li>\n<p>the antithesis of freedom by Marx: unfreedom</p>\n<ul>\n<li>as soon as we have division of labor, we are no longer free</li>\n<li>we are forever trapped in the sphere of an exclusive activity </li>\n<li>we are alienated from our true self  </li>\n<li>we can only reach freedom under the enormous abundance of wealth (?)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Marx is a objectivist, believes in objectivism </p>\n<ul>\n<li>materialist conception of history shapes the way history unfold </li>\n<li>it predicts how capitalism will play out its conflict </li>\n<li>reductionism </li>\n<li>political actions are determined by economic interest </li>\n<li>class in itself vs class for itself</li>\n<li>\n<p>Marx is an individualist, despite he considers thing on a class level</p>\n<ul>\n<li>he defines classes by how individuals relate to the mean of production</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>class-in-itself: you are working a nice high paying job living in nice\nhouses, you are still part of the working class, regardless if you\nunderstand it or not.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>objective division of class</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>class-for-itself: if you don’t believe that you are working class, then\nyou are not working class. </li>\n<li>Marx thinks what ultimately drives conflict and development is\nclass-in-itself, regardless of how subject perceives it, it is objective.</li>\n<li>utopia situation: people will realize that objectively what class they\nare in, meaning class-in-itself equals class-for-itself</li>\n<li>question: working class can also now buy stocks, they are capitalist, but also working class</li>\n<li>simple-minded according to Marx’s classification of working vs capitalist class?</li>\n<li>if you need to work to survive, then you are working class (aka\nfinancial freedom)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>source of value is work/labor</p>\n<ul>\n<li>social necessary labor time (SNLT): labor time required to produce\nuse-value (anything with utility) under the conditions of production normal\nfor a given society and with the <strong>average degree of skill and intensity</strong>\nof the labor prevalent in the society.</li>\n<li>making things twice as fast/slow is socially unneeded labor, we focus\non the average</li>\n<li>equilibrium price of commodity is determined by the amount of SNLT went into that commodity </li>\n<li>the labor theory of surplus value </li>\n<li>def: living human labor-power is the <strong>only source</strong> of fresh value </li>\n<li>all commodity is result of human work </li>\n<li>\n<p>labor is also a kind of commodity, wages are determined by the cost to\nproduce the labor, not by the value that the labor produces </p>\n<ul>\n<li>if so, why is celebrity get paid so much?</li>\n<li>the max cost is determined by the max amount of time in a day </li>\n<li>but there are cost that are paid not by the labor itself but by\nother parties</li>\n<li>other people that didn’t end up becoming celebrities</li>\n<li>winner-take-all market (Marx didn’t offer the best explanation for that)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>consumption of labor power retains value, not like other commodity (like food)</li>\n<li>constant capital (everything else but wages) vs variable capital (wages)</li>\n<li>\n<p>why variable?
